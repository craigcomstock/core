Here we have Dockerfiles to build images which we publish to hub.docker.com

# agent

This is a minimal image, around 14MB, which includes
- alpine:latest
- cfengine
- cfengine-masterfiles

Run with

```
docker run -it cfengine/agent /bin/sh
cf-agent -IB $(hostname -i)
cf-agent -KIf update.cf
cf-agent -KI
```

Or just run your policy directly by mapping a local directory to /var/lib/cfengine/inputs

```
docker run -i cfengine/agent -v ${pwd}:/var/lig/cfengine/inputs /usr/bin/cf-agent -KI
```
